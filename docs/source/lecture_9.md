# Lecture 9

## Topic

In this lecture you learn how to train models in pytorch. We work with the same model
as in lecture 8, but this time do not implement it from scratch. Instead we re-use
components form Pytorch.

## Suggested Homework

- Play around with different optimizers
- Extend the code from the exercises to get better logging or visualization of the training process
- Try out larger or smaller networks

### Blogpost about optimizers

This [excellent blogpost](https://www.ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) discusses
all optimizers we looked at and many more.

### How to store GitHub credentials

Storing GitHub credentials means that you do not have to type in your username and
password each time you push or pull from the repository. Here is the
[documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).
