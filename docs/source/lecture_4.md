## Additional materials


### Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

A slightly outdated but very accessible introduction to machine learning is the book
[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/) by Andreas MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido.

In the lecture we had only time to cover supervised learning (and there only
classification). The book would be a good source for anyone who wants to read up on
unsupervised learning methods (e.g. clustering and dimensionality reduction). It also
contains a lot more background on the things we covered here and

### Chapter 5 of the Python Data Science Handbook

We have used the [book](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.00-machine-learning.html)
before. It starts by introducing some fundamental concepts and continues with in-depth
chapters for different methods. Definitely have a look if you want to use a method we
did not cover in enough detail here.

### JEP Paper

This [paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.31.2.87) by Mullainathan
and Spiess (Journal of Economic Perspectives) is a great summary of the similarities
and differences between econometrics and Machine Learning.

### Online-courses

If you want to get much deeper into machine learning, you can have a look at
Sebastian Raschka's [online course](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2021/ml-course.html).
He also has a very recent course on deep learning.


### Summary paper about scores for multiclass classification

Comprehensive paper
[paper](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2008.05756/#:~:text=Accuracy%20is%20one%20of%20the,computed%20from%20the%20confusion%20matrix.&text=The%20formula%20of%20the%20Accuracy,confusion%20matrix%20at%20the%20denominator.) on the different scores for multiclass
classification.
