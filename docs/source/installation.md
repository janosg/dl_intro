# Installation

The following contains everything you need to know to install Python and all relevant packages on your computer, access online computing resources and run jupyter notebooks. Please read it carefully before approaching us with questions.

We describe one way of doing things that works. Sometimes there are alternative ways (e.g. using a different shell, using a graphical interface instead of a shell, ...). If you know what you are doing, feel free to do things differently but be aware that we do not provide help if you run into problems in that case.
