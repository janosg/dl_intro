### Working with Notebooks

There is a good [quantecon lecture](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/getting_started.html#notebook-basics) on working with Notebooks. While the exact looks might differ, the basics are the same whether you run the notebook locally or in a cloud.

### Creating and activating conda environments

If you want to work outside of JupyterHub, you should do it in the course environment.

```{eval-rst}
:download:`windows <_static/environment_windows.yml>`
:download:`mac and linux <_static/environment.yml>`
```

Remember that while you only have to create the environment once, you need to activate it each time you re-open your terminal.
