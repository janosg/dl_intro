## Suggested Homework

- Re-do or finish the exercise notebook a few days after class to practice the basics
- Go through chapter 2 and 3 of the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/#2.-Introduction-to-NumPy) and type all the code examples into a jupyter notebook.
- Watch the concise introduction to pandas (see below)


## Additional materials

### Python Data Science Handbook

The excellent [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/#2.-Introduction-to-NumPy) by Jake VanderPlas has a free online version. The lecture slides on numpy and pandas are based on Chapter 2 and 3 of that book. However, the book is more complete.


### Concise Intro to pandas

This video is a very short introduction to pandas that covers topics that will be useful in this class:

### Video Series on Pandas

The following video series is completely optional and goes much deeper than what we need. The video titles in the playlist are very informative. I would not suggest to watch all of this from start to finiss but to watch a video if you are struggling with a specific topic in your finl project.

### Numpy tutorial from the scipy conference

This is a detailed tutorial on numpy. It goes beyond what we need in the class but is a good starting point if you want to learn more.
