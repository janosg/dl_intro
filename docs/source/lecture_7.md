- Finish all the exercises you could not solve in class
- Think about a final project you could tackle with the skills you already have

## Additional materials

### Natural Language Processing with transformers

The book [Natural language processing with transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/) has served as basis for many of the course materials.

Chapter 2 covers the material of this lecture.

### Why are GPUs used for deep learning

This is a purely optional video that gives you some more background and analogies that
might be helpful to understad why GPUs are used for deep learning.

### Video introduction to the huggingface Trainer

This video introduction by one of the authors of the Transformers book goes deeper than
what we did in class and shows you how to deal with class imbalance. It uses the same
example dataset as in class.
