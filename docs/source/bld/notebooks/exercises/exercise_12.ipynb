    "#### Extra: HTML and XPATH\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Selenium very powerful compared to more traditional web scraping framework, is that we can easily extract the parts of the html we want. This makes it easy to get clean data sets from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of downloading whole html pages, and then clean out the data, we can give Selenium instruction to where the elements we want are located, and then extract only this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*HTML*, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of every website you see on the internet. It is a simple and powerful language used to create the structure and content of web pages. Think of HTML as the skeleton that gives a web page its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        First div\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            Second div\n",
    "            <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Middle input\" />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        Third div\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*XPath* is a query language used to navigate and select elements from a HTML document. It provides a concise way to locate specific elements or extract data based on their element structure, attributes, or content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the input element in the code above, we would have to feed Selenium with\n",
    "    \n",
    "    /html/body/div[1]/div/input[@placeholder='Middle input']\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In our case...\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the element where you provide your username at twitter in full XPATH:\n",

    "    div[5]/label/div/div[2]/div/input\"\n",
